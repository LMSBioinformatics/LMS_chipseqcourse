Part 1/ 
Gonna use Myc and CTCF..ER or Foxa1 would be good.
Intro to sequencing and process of ChIP-seq.
- Practical parts of Chip-seq/DNA-seq
- fastq
- bam
- bigWigs/Coverage graphs
- Bed/narrowPeak

Part 2/
Where to start.
- Getting data .. sraDB, geoQuery, AnnotationHub
- basecalling
- Fastq quality control
- Alignments
- Initial QC.


Then a practical?

Maybe align uniquely to genome and non-uniquely. Show the BL hump does go

## Be nice to have a fix seqlevels.
## Could we use gist as forum

Part 3/
Coverage
- Creating coverage.
- Working with Coverage and Views.
- Exporting bigWigs.
- Visualising coverage using soGGI.

Blacklist may fit in here…or eliminating self peaks in control
add to prac — stranded bigwig.

Part 4/
Enriched Intervals.
- Input bias and Blacklists.
- Peak Calling.
- More quality control..point out summit.
- Manipulations Gand adding context. -- nearest etc. 
— Consensus peaks?

Part 5/
Differential Binding analysis.
- Counting in peaks.
- DE using DESEQ2.
- DE using EdgeR.
—— Future of peak counting..

Part 6/
Functional analysis.
- Enrichment testing of functional terms.
—— by hand,
——rGreat
- Motif analysis known.
—— matchPWM CTCF vs Myc Motif.
- Motif analysis denovo.
—— Biostrings from Regions.
—- Meme-ChIP
-— Stamp
— RGadem/Motv/MotfiStack
- Adding motifs using soGGI.
——Plotting motif coverage in soGGi



Fomr 1 - 4 any practicals will be smaller examples of what we show is possible by same code on the slides. Make point of saying that.


Notes 
GEO

Notes on what to put in video..not for course but for later review

Effectively go in

Show lots of different datatypes.

Foxa1 search

Show metadata

Show raw, bw and processed data.

Show link to SRA


\\\\
SRA video

Show more sequencing specific metadata

Mock SRA format

\\\\\

\ena

Search Foxa1

Look at studies.

Show expanding columns

Retrieve fastq file.
