Part 1/ 
Gonna use Myc and CTCF..ER or Foxa1 would be good.
Intro to sequencing and process of ChIP-seq.
- Practical parts of Chip-seq/DNA-seq
- fastq
- bam
- bigWigs/Coverage graphs
- Bed/narrowPeak

Part 2/
Where to start.
- Getting data .. sraDB, geoQuery, AnnotationHub
- basecalling
- Fastq quality control
- Alignments
- Initial QC.


Then a practical?

## Be nice to have a fix seqlevels.
## Could we use gist as forum

Part 3/
Coverage
- Creating coverage.
- Working with Coverage and Views.
- Exporting bigWigs.
- Visualising coverage using soGGI.

Blacklist may fit in here…or eliminating self peaks in control
add to prac — stranded bigwig.

Part 4/
Enriched Intervals.
- Input bias and Blacklists.
- Peak Calling.
- More quality control..point out summit.
- Manipulations Gand adding context. -- nearest etc. 
— Consensus peaks?

Part 5/
Differential Binding analysis.
- Counting in peaks.
- DE using DESEQ2.
- DE using EdgeR.
—— Future of peak counting..

Part 6/
Functional analysis.
- Enrichment testing of functional terms.
—— by hand,
——rGreat
- Motif analysis known.
—— matchPWM CTCF vs Myc Motif.
- Motif analysis denovo.
—— Biostrings from Regions.
—- Meme-ChIP
-— Stamp
— RGadem/Motv/MotfiStack
- Adding motifs using soGGI.
——Plotting motif coverage in soGGi



Fomr 1 - 4 any practicals will be smaller examples of what we show is possible by same code on the slides. Make point of saying that.
